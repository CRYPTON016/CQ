      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Yeah yeah yeah I have to say this, I'm not a prodigy or a genius. I'm a pretty average normal guy who believes with sheer will power and dedication & hardwork we can achive our goals...! I would choose failure over regret. </p>
      <p>Personally I like to Read Books, Travel a lot, the Mountains and Waterbodies help me calm my soul, as i do trekking and swimming i just lose myself in the hands of nature a blissful feeling i simply cannot describe with words you've to experience it. I wish to do them alone it gives a me-time where i can organise my thoughts and meditate myself to overthink about future, talk about how i messed up and so on and on..</p>
      <p>I go to Mountains to fix my Mental Health and i realised that my Physical Health is equally fucked up... </p>
      <h3> Career?? </h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Okay, I admit it, Cloud & Cybersecurity wasn't exactly my master plan. It was just a whim, a random thought that popped into my head one day.<!-- --> <!-- -->Little did I know, that casual whim unlocked a secret door – a<!-- --> <span class="font-medium text-slate-200">wonderland of creativity, logic, and endless learning.</span> <!-- -->Building things in cloud, conjuring websites from thin air, and watching them interact with the world – it was like playing with Legos for grown-ups, but way cooler. And the thrill?<!-- --> <span class="font-medium text-slate-200">Unreal.</span> <!-- -->Fast-forward to today, Three years in, and I'm not just an engineer – I'm an accidental adventurer, riding the waves of cloud with a grin on my face. From spearheading projects that make a difference to navigating the exhilarating chaos of rapid growth, every day is a new frontier</p>
